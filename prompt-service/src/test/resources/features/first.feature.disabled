Feature: Tests the prompt Workflow Service using a REST client. This is done only for the
first testcase. Prompt service exists and is under test.
It helps to create a prompt and manages the state of the prompt as documented in states xml
Scenario: Create a new prompt
Given that "flowName" equals "prompt-flow"
And that "initialState" equals "DRAFT"
When I POST a REST request to URL "/prompt" with payload
"""json
{
    "description": "Description"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.id" from response to "id"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${initialState}"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "currentState"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.description" is "Description"

Scenario: Retrieve the prompt that just got created
    When I GET a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}"
    Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${currentState}"

 Scenario: Submit the prompt
    When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/submit" with payload
    """json
    {
        "comment": "Submitting"
    }
    """
    Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
    And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "OPEN"
    And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "currentState"

 Scenario: Send the validate event to the prompt with comments
 Given that "comment" equals "Comment for validate"
 And that "event" equals "validate"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}",
    "score": 5
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "VALIDATED"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"

 Scenario: Send the deprecate event to the prompt with comments
 Given that "comment" equals "Comment for deprecate"
 And that "event" equals "deprecate"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "DEPRECATED"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"


Scenario: Add new mandatory activities a1,a2 for the last state.
Add a new state "__TERMINAL_STATE__"
Add a completion checker activity "cc" to the last state that leads to __TERMINAL_STATE__
Send cc event on the prompt with comments. This should fail since the mandatory activities
have not been completed.
Given that "terminalState" equals "__TERMINAL_STATE__"
And that config strategy is "promptConfigProvider" with prefix "Prompt"
And that a new mandatory activity "a1" is added from state "${finalState}" to state "${finalState}" in flow "${flowName}"
And that a new mandatory activity "a2" is added from state "${finalState}" to state "${finalState}" in flow "${flowName}"
And that a new state "${terminalState}" is added to flow "${flowName}"
And that a new activity completion checker "cc" is added from state "${finalState}" to state "${terminalState}" in flow "${flowName}"
And that "comment" equals "Attempting to send cc event without mandatory activities being completed."
And that "event" equals "cc"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
    {
    "comment": "${comment}"
    }
"""
Then the REST response does not contain key "mutatedEntity"
And success is false
And the http status code is 400
And the top level subErrorCode is 49000

Scenario: Retrieve the prompt that just got created
When I GET a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}"
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${finalState}"

Scenario: Perform mandatory activity (a1) on the  prompt with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Performed activity a1."
And that "event" equals "a1"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
"comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${finalState}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.activities" collection has an item with keys and values:
| key             | value         |
| activityName    | ${event}      |
| activityComment | ${comment}    |

Scenario: Perform mandatory activity (a2) on the  prompt with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Performed activity a2."
And that "event" equals "a2"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
"comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${finalState}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.activities" collection has an item with keys and values:
| key             | value         |
| activityName    | ${event}      |
| activityComment | ${comment}    |

Scenario: Perform mandatory activity (close) on the  prompt with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Performed activity close after completing all activities."
And that "event" equals "close"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
"comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "CLOSED"

Scenario: Send an invalid event to prompt . This will err out.
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/prompt/${id}/invalid" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "invalid stuff"
}
"""
Then the REST response does not contain key "mutatedEntity"
And the http status code is 422
